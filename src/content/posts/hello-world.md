# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first post on my new Astro-powered blog. I'm using **Decap CMS** for content management and **Cloudflare Pages** for hosting.

## Why Astro?

Astro is a modern static site generator that offers:

- Zero JavaScript by default
- Content collections with type safety
- Excellent performance out of the box
- Great developer experience

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing more posts about web development, technology, and other topics I find interesting. Stay tuned!

```javascript
// Here's some example code
console.log('Hello from Astro!');
```

Thanks for reading!
